* What are three specific things (e.g., functions or arguments) that you saw today that were different from or were not included in what we had covered previously in class? Include what each of these new things does (i.e., what does it do? what is its purpose?).

&nbsp;

* Besides the things in your first answer, what are two reflective thoughts you had during or after today's demonstrations. Preferably these thoughts reflect back on what we have covered during the course or reflect forward to how you will use `ggplot2` or create graphics in the future.
