<div id="annual-temperature-anomaly" class="section level2">
<h2>Annual Temperature Anomaly</h2>
<p>Make the plot shown under <a href="https://derekogle.com/NCGraphing/modules/Intro2/CE_Temperature.html#bonus-annual-temperature-anomaly-5">“BONUS - Annual Temperature Anomaly 5” on this page</a>, but add an appropriate title, subtitle, and caption (and decide if it is worth keeping the x- and y-axis labels).</p>

<div id="state-and-no-good-deer-hunting" class="section level2">
<h2>State and No Good Deer Hunting</h2>
<p>Make the plot shown under <a href="https://derekogle.com/NCGraphing/modules/Univariate_Groups/CE_Wolves.html#state-and-no-good-deer-hunting-1">“State and No Good Deer Hunting 1” on this page</a>. I have since learned that these data were preliminary and that results from Minnesota had largely not been entered into the database. Add a note on the <strong>inside</strong> of the plot that explains this. You should include an arrow that appropriately points to the low bar for Minnesota.</p>

<div id="total-annual-harvest-by-county-and-year" class="section level2">
<h2>Total Annual Harvest by County and Year</h2>
<p>Legends for very simple plot scan sometimes waste space and be distracting. Such an example may be the legend for the plot shown under <a href="https://derekogle.com/NCGraphing/modules/Means/CE_DeerHarvest.html#total-annual-harvest-by-county-and-year">“Total Annual Harvest by County and Year” on this page</a>. One alternative is to place a small label near the lines in the plot, as shown below. Construct <code>ggplot2</code> code to match this graph.</p>

<div id="costs-of-college-i" class="section level2">
<h2>Costs of College I</h2>
<p>Costs of attending college can be compared across colleges at <a href="https://www.collegetuitioncompare.com/">www.collegetuitioncompare.com</a>. The data in <a href="https://derekogle.com/NCGraphing/modules/Annotations/WI_College_Costs.csv">this CSV file</a> contains cost information for four-year private colleges and universities in Wisconsin. Construct <code>ggplot2</code> code to emulate the plot below (<em>as closely as you can</em>). Note that the dashed line is the line where on-campus and off-campus costs are equal and, by definition, has a slope of 1 and an intercept of zero. This line can be added to the plot with <code>geom_abline()</code> (you may need to perform an internet search for how to use this function). Also note that I widened the “padding” around the text in the two “cheaper” labels by including <code>label.padding=unit(0.35,"lines")</code> in the appropriate function.</p>

<div id="bonus---costs-of-college-ii" class="section level2">
<h2>BONUS - Costs of College II</h2>
<p>Construct <code>ggplot2</code> code to emulate the plot below (<em>as closely as you can</em>). Note that this uses code from a package other than <code>ggplot2</code> that is used to place text in locations that minimize overlap of other text (i.e., text labels are <strong>repel</strong>led from each other).</p>
