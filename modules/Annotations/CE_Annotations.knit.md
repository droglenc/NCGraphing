## Annual Temperature Anomaly
Make the plot shown under ["BONUS - Annual Temperature Anomaly 5" on this page](https://derekogle.com/NCGraphing/modules/Intro2/CE_Temperature.html#bonus-annual-temperature-anomaly-5), but add an appropriate title, subtitle, and caption (and decide if it is worth keeping the x- and y-axis labels).

## State and No Good Deer Hunting
Make the plot shown under ["State and No Good Deer Hunting 1" on this page](https://derekogle.com/NCGraphing/modules/Univariate_Groups/CE_Wolves.html#state-and-no-good-deer-hunting-1). I have since learned that these data were preliminary and that results from Minnesota had largely not been entered into the database. Add a note on the **inside** of the plot that explains this. You should include an arrow that appropriately points to the low bar for Minnesota.
