# Graphing Univariate Groups
### Derek Ogle, April 2020

---






# Background

- The General Sociological Survey (GSS) gathers data on American society to monitor and explain trends in attitudes, behaviors, and attributes.
  - Initiated in 1972.
  - Can be accessed from [NORC at the University of Chicago](https://gss.norc.org/)

]

---

# Background

- Downloaded data on the following four characteristics or questions:
  - Respondent's sex.
  - Respondent's race.
  - Respondent's highest educational degree.
  - "Generally speaking, how concerned are you about environmental issues?"
  - "how willing would you be to accept cuts in your standard of living in order to protect the environment?"
- [Data available here](https://derekogle.com/NCGraphing/modules/zdata/GSSENVIRO_2010.csv)

---

# Background

- Loaded data into `gss` data.frame.
  - Removed "missing data."
  - Converted codes to questions.
  - Converted all variables to factors, ordered levels where appropriate.


```r
gss &lt;- read.csv("https://derekogle.com/NCGraphing/modules/zdata/GSSENVIRO_2010.csv",
                na.strings=c("na","NA","-1","7","8","9","98","99")) %&gt;%
  mutate(SEX=plyr::mapvalues(SEX,from=1:2,to=c("Male","Female")),
         RACE=plyr::mapvalues(RACE,from=1:3,to=c("White","Black","Other")),
         DEGREE=plyr::mapvalues(DEGREE,from=0:4,
           to=c("Less than HS","High School","Junior College","Bachelors","Graduate School")),
         GRNSOL = plyr::mapvalues(GRNSOL,from=0:5,
           to=c(NA_character_,"Very","Fairly","Neither","Not Very","Not At All")),
         GRNCON = plyr::mapvalues(GRNCON,from=0:5,
           to=c(NA_character_,"Not at All","Not Much","Neither","Somewhat","Very"))) %&gt;%

  mutate(SEX=factor(SEX),RACE=factor(RACE,levels=c("White","Black","Other")),
         DEGREE=factor(DEGREE,levels=c("Less than HS","High School","Junior College","Bachelors","Graduate School")),
         GRNSOL = factor(GRNSOL,levels=c("Not At All","Not Very","Neither","Fairly","Very")),
         GRNCON = factor(GRNCON,levels=c("Not at All","Not Much","Neither","Somewhat","Very")))
```

```r

```
     SEX  RACE         DEGREE   GRNCON ENPRBUS     GRNSOL
1   Male Other      Bachelors  Neither       9     Fairly
2 Female White      Bachelors Somewhat       9     Fairly
3 Female White   Less than HS  Neither       3 Not At All

5 Female Black    High School     Very       1       Very
6 Female Black Junior College     Very       1 Not At All
```

- Variables used are:
  - **SEX**: Sex of respondent (`Female` or `Male`).
  - **DEGREE**: Respondent's highest completed degree.
  - **GRNSOL**: Response to "willingness to cut standard of living" question.

# Bar Chart

.pull-left[
- Displays the frequency of observations in levels of the categorical *X* variable.
- Constructed with `geom_bar()`.
  - `position=`: Controls position of bars with groups.
  - `width=`: Width of bars.
