[sports-reference.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/) has a wealth of information on major American sports. In this exercise, statistics for college quarterbacks from the 2019-20 season will be explored. Before loading these data, load the `tidyverse` package, which will load `ggplot2` along with a few other packages you will need to access these data.


```r
library(tidyverse)
```

Perform the following steps to load information [in this file](https://derekogle.com/NCGraphing/modules/zdata/Data_quarterbacks_2019.csv) for all quarterbacks from the 2019-20 seasons that were in the so-called "power 5 conferences."[^getdata]
