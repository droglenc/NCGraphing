## Background
<img src="zimgs/loon.jpg" alt="Common Loon" class="img-right">

[sports-reference.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/) has a wealth of information on major American sports. In this exercise, statistics for college quarterbacks from the 2019-20 season will be explored. Before loading these data, load the `tidyverse` pacakge, which will load `ggplot2` along with a few other packages you will need access these data.

```{r results="hide"}
library(tidyverse)
```

Perform the following steps to load information for all quarterbacks from the 2019-20 seasons that were in the so-called "power 5 conferences."[^getdata]

```{r echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
qbs <- read.csv("Data_quarterbacks_2019.csv",stringsAsFactors=FALSE) %>%
  filter(Conf %in% c("ACC","Big 12","Big Ten","Pac-12","SEC")) %>%
  mutate(Conf=factor(Conf))
str(qbs)
```

Here we will only use the following variables:

&nbsp;

## Passing Efficiency vs. Interceptions
Construct `ggplot2` code to match the graph below (as closely as you can).

```{r QBS_risk}
risk <- ggplot(data=qbs,mapping=aes(x=Int,y=Y_A)) +
  geom_point(size=3) +
  scale_x_continuous(name="Number of Interceptions") +
  scale_y_continuous(name="Passing Yards per Passing Attempt") +
  theme_bw()
risk
```

&nbsp;

## Passing Attempts vs Rushing Attempts 1
Construct `ggplot2` code to match the graph below (as closely as you can). [*HINT: The graphic at [the bottom of this page](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_shape.html#examples) might be useful.*]

```{r QBS_act}
act <- ggplot(data=qbs,mapping=aes(x=RAtt,y=Att)) +
  geom_point(size=3,shape=15,color="red3",alpha=0.5) +
  scale_x_continuous(name="Rushing Attempts") +
  scale_y_continuous(name="Passing Attempts") +
  theme_bw()
act
```

&nbsp;

## Passing Attempts vs Rushing Attempts 2
Construct `ggplot2` code to match the graph below (as closely as you can).

```{r QBS_act2, fig.width=6}
act2 <- ggplot(data=qbs,mapping=aes(x=RAtt,y=Att,color=Conf)) +
  geom_point(size=3) +
  scale_x_continuous(name="Rushing Attempts") +
  scale_y_continuous(name="Passing Attempts") +
  theme_bw()
act2
```

&nbsp;

## Passing Attempts vs Rushing Attempts 3
Construct `ggplot2` code to match the graph below (as closely as you can).

```{r QBS_act3, fig.width=6}
act3 <- ggplot(data=qbs,mapping=aes(x=RAtt,y=Att,color=Pct)) +
  geom_point(size=3) +
  scale_x_continuous(name="Rushing Attempts") +
  scale_y_continuous(name="Passing Attempts") +
  theme_bw()
act3
```

&nbsp;

## Passing Attempts vs Rushing Attempts 4
Construct `ggplot2` code to match the graph below (as closely as you can).

```{r QBS_act4, fig.width=6}
act4 <- ggplot(data=qbs,mapping=aes(x=RAtt,y=Att,color=Conf,shape=Conf)) +
  geom_point(size=3) +
  scale_x_continuous(name="Rushing Attempts") +
  scale_y_continuous(name="Passing Attempts") +
  theme_bw()
act4
```

&nbsp;

## Passing Attempts vs Rushing Attempts 5
Modify your plot from "Passing Attempts vs Rushing Attempts 2" to use five *divergent* colors for the different conferences that are *colorlind-safe* and *printer-friendly*. See the [color brewer website](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3) or [these color-blind-friendly pallettes](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_(ggplot2)/#a-colorblind-friendly-palette) for help with this. Note that hexadecimal codes for colors can be entered the same as names of colors. An example is below.

```{r QBS_act5, fig.width=6}
act5 <- act2 +
  scale_color_manual(values=c("#000000", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73", "#F0E442"))
act5
```

[^getdata]: These data were obtained from https://www.sports-reference.com/ with the following steps: 1) Select "CFB" in the list of sports in the gray box near the top of the page; 2) Select "Years" in the list of items in teh gray box near the top of the page; 3) Select "2019" in the list of years; 4) Hover over "Stats" in the gray box near the middle of the page and select "Passing" from the items that will appear; 5) Hover over the "Share & more" item just above the top-right side of the table of statistics and select "Get Table as a CSV"; and 6) copy CSV result to a text file, delete the first line, and slighly modify the variable names.
