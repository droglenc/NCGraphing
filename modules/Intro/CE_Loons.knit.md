## Background
<img src="loon.jpg" alt="Common Loon" class="img-right">
Dr. Jim Paruk studied the morphology of Common Loons (*Gavia immer*), primarily their bills, from a wide variety of locations in North America. These data are in [Loon1.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/Loon1.csv), with information about these data in [this metadata file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/Loon1_meta.txt). Download these data (from the link in the previous sentence), load them into R, and examine their structure. [*How load a CSV file into RStudio is [described in this video](https://vimeo.com/144035138), for which the password is "NCStats" (without the quotes).*]
