## Background
<img src="zimgs/Walleye.jpg" alt="Walleye" class="img-right">
Kaggle has a database of the price and sales of avocados from many areas around the United States from 2015-2018. The [data is here](https://derekogle.com/NCGraphing/modules/Intro/avocados.csv) (with [metadata under "columns" at this site](https://www.kaggle.com/neuromusic/avocado-prices).[^getdata] Before loading these data, load the `tidyverse` package, which will load `ggplot2` along with a few other packages you will need to access these data.

```{r echo=TRUE, results="hide"}
library(tidyverse)
```

Their data are loaded below and, for this exercise, reduced to only results for the "GreatLakes" region. In addition the type and year were forced to be factor variables.[^loaddata]

```{r echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
avoc <- read.csv("https://derekogle.com/NCGraphing/modules/Intro/avocados.csv",
                stringsAsFactors=FALSE) %>%
  filter(region=="GreatLakes") %>%
  mutate(type=factor(type),
         year=factor(year))
str(avoc)
```

&nbsp;

## Example 1
Construct `ggplot2` code to match the graph below (as closely as you can).

```{r avoc1, fig.width=6}
avoc1 <- ggplot(data=avoc,mapping=aes(x=AveragePrice,y=Total.Bags,
                                      color=year,shape=type)) +
  geom_point(size=3,alpha=0.5) +
  scale_x_continuous(name="Average Price of An Avocados ($)") +
  scale_y_continuous(name="Total Number of Bags Sold") +
  scale_color_manual(values=c("#000000","#E69F00","#56B4E9","#009E73")) +
  theme_bw()
avoc1
```

[^getdata]: This CSV file is freely available from Kaggle at [this page](). However, you must sign-in to download the data file. I did this and made it available from my website at the link above.

[^loaddata]: These data were read directly from the webpage. However, the data can be downloaded to your computer and loaded from there into R, which would be similar to how you would load your own data into R. How to load a CSV file into RStudio is [described in this video](https://vimeo.com/144035138), for which the password is "NCStats" (without the quotes).
