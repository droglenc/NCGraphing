## What are R and RStudio?
Throughout this course we will use the R program to generate graphs. We will interact with R through the RStudio software. From your perspective, you will be using RStudio, but you will actually be writing code in the R language. RStudio simply helps make R a little easier to use. The following links provide very brief introductions to R and RStudio.
