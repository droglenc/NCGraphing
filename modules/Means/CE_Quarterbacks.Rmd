## Background
<img src="../zimgs/qb.jpg" alt="Quarterback" class="img-right">
This is the same data set [introduced here](../Intro2/CE_Quarterbacks.html) (which included code for accessing the data). If you did those exercises, then you can use the same data and package (e.g., `tidyverse`) loading portion of your script. If you did not do those exercises then please see that page for the instructions on loading the data.

## Total Passing Yards by Conference 1
Construct `ggplot2` code to match the graph below (as closely as you can).

```{r Quarterbacks_PYds1}
PYds1 <- ggplot(data=qbs,mapping=aes(x=Conf,y=PYds)) +
  geom_violin(color="gray50",fill="gray70",alpha=0.5,trim=FALSE) +
  stat_summary(fun.data=mean_cl_normal,geom="pointrange",size=1,shape=3) +
  scale_y_continuous(name="Mean (95% CI) Total Passing Yards") +
  scale_x_discrete(name="Conference") +
  theme_minimal()
PYds1
```

&nbsp;

## Total Passing Yards by Conference and Attempts
Construct `ggplot2` code to match the graph below (as closely as you can).

```{r Quarterbacks_PYds2}
PYds2 <- ggplot(data=qbs,mapping=aes(x=Conf,y=PYds,color=Att>350)) +
  stat_summary(fun.data=mean_cl_normal,geom="pointrange",
               size=1,shape=21,fill="white",
               position=position_dodge(width=0.2)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name="Mean (95% CI) Total Passing Yards") +
  scale_x_discrete(name="Conference") +
  theme_bw()
PYds2
```

## Total Passing Yards by Conference 2
Construct `ggplot2` code to match the graph below (as closely as you can). [*HINT: Copy your code from above and then modify.*]

```{r Quarterbacks_PYds3}
smry <- qbs %>%
  group_by(Conf) %>%
  summarize(n=n(),
            mean=mean(PYds,na.rm=TRUE),
            sd=sd(PYds,na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(se=sd/sqrt(n),
         ci=qt(0.975,df=n-1)*se,
         lci=mean-ci,
         uci=mean+ci)

PYds3 <- ggplot(data=smry,mapping=aes(x=Conf,y=mean)) +
  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin=lci,ymax=uci),pch=21,fill="white",size=1) +
  geom_label(aes(label=formatC(mean,format="f",digits=0)),hjust=-0.25) +
  scale_x_discrete(name="Conference") +
  scale_y_continuous(name="Mean Total Passing Yards (95% CI) (g)") +
  theme_bw()
PYds3
```

## BONUS - Total Passing Yards by Conference 3
Construct `ggplot2` code to match the graph below (as closely as you can). *Hint: If you saved your plot from the previous section, you should be able to create this plot by "adding" one function of code to the saved ggplot object.*

```{r Quarterbacks_PYds4}
PYds4 <- PYds3 +
  geom_jitter(data=qbs,aes(x=Conf,y=PYds),width=0.075,alpha=0.5)
PYds4
```
