<p><img src="../zimgs/Deer.jpg" alt="Deer" class="img-right"> Deer hunting is ingrained in the culture and is big business in northern Wisconsin. Thus, management of the Whitetail Deer (<em>Odocoileus virginianus</em>) populations in this area is an important issue. Harvest rules and recommendations are based on recommendations from the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and the County Deer Advisory Councils (CDACs), which are made up of local citizents, to the Natural Resources Board. One piece of evidence used in these recommendations are past harvest statistics. The harvest of deer from Douglas, Bayfield, Ashland, and Iron Counties, the northern-most tier of couties in Wisconsin, from 2010-2019 were recorded in the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/DeerHarvest.csv">DeerHarvest.csv file</a>, with <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/DeerHarvest_meta.txt">these metadata</a>.</p>
