title: Cloud Save HTML File
---

When you "knit" your Rmarkdown file it will produce an HTML in your workspace and pop open a viewer of that HTML file. The HTML file is what you should upload to mycourses as your homework submissions ([here are directions for doing that](Submit_HW){:target="_blank"}). However, before submitting this HTML file you must get it from your RStudio Cloud workspace to your computer. Below are two ways to do this.

## Exporting from RStudio in the Cloud
The file may be exported directly from RStudio in the Cloud with the following steps.

* In the lower-right pane, select the Files tab so that all files in your Cloud space are shown.
* In the list of files, check the box in front of the HTML file of interest. Then select the "More" tab in the pane toolbar and then the "Export" item.

* Press the "Download" button.

* Save the file to your computer.

## Open in Browser, then Save
When you "knit"ted the document it will pop open in a browswer built into RStudio. **Do NOT save from this browser.** Rather, select the "Open in Browser" item to open this in your default web browser. Once open there, save the file to your computer (in most broswers, you can right-click on the page and then select "Save Page As" (it may save "Save File As" or something similar, depending on the browswer)).
